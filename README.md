# CS260 Final Project

## Goal: A meme way to break the social echo chamber

## Project information
Overall this is a react app. Most of the code is developed in JSX. The page folder contains all the pages, and the style folder contains all the style for the pages (global styles are in the index.css file). All the front end code should use JSX, vanilla Javascript and JQuery are not accepted. For style, it's okay to experiment with CSS, but production level build should use SASS.

## TODO
- [ ] Add admin console and authentication for it
- [ ] Populate homepage
- [ ] Add mobile support (shouldn't take too long)
- [ ] Configure manifest file
- [ ] Add hashtag detection, database support, and render method
- [ ] Improve UI design for statistics page
- [x] Change color for comment page
