# CS260 Final Project

## Goal: A meme way to break the social echo chamber

## Project information
Overall this is a react app. Most of the code is developed in JSX. The page folder contains all the pages, and the style folder contains all the style for the pages (global styles are in the index.css file). All the front end code should use JSX, vanilla Javascript and JQuery are not accepted (unless a uncessary package does not support npm module). For style, it's okay to experiment with CSS, but production level build should use SASS for better scalability.
