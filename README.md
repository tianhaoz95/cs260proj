# CS260 Final Project

## Goal: A meme way to break the social echo chamber

## Project information
Overall this is a react app. Most of the code is developed in JSX. The page folder contains all the pages, and the style folder contains all the style for the pages (global styles are in the index.css file). All the front end code should use JSX, vanilla Javascript and JQuery are not accepted. For style, it's okay to experiment with CSS, but production level build should use SASS.

## TODO
- [x] ~~Add redirect to meme maker on contribute page~~
- [ ] Fix styling issue in Dropzone component on contribute page
- [x] ~~Change the background to gradient~~
- [ ] Add admin console and authentication for it
- [ ] Populate homepage

- [x] ~~Configure manifest file~~
- [ ] improve the machanism for what hashtags to show
